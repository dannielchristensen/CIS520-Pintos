# CIS520-Project1
First project for CIS520
If pintos DOES NOT run. You might have to update your path to reflect the new location of pintos (since it will be downloaded from this repo):

export PATH=/<home directory>/cis520/CIS520-Pintos/pintos/src/utils:/<home directory>/cis520/usr/local/bin:$PATH

export BXSHARE=/<home directory>/cis520/usr/local/share/bochs

then run: source "~/.bashrc"

If that does not fix the issue, then you may have to run "make" in src/utils and src/threads.
