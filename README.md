# CIS520-Project1
First project for CIS520
If pintos DOES NOT run. You might have to edit your path and add:

export PATH=/<home directory>/cis520/pintos/src/utils:/<home directory>/cis520/usr/local/bin:$PATH

export BXSHARE=/<home directory>/cis520/usr/local/share/bochs

then run: source "~/.bashrc"

If that does not fix the issue, then you may have to run "make" in src/utils and src/threads.
